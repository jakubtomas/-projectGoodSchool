My homework (School)


Hello students,

I am sending you information about the project..
Name of the project: projectGoodSchool
Deadline: 7.1.2020

I have attached the file "students.dat" and class diagram.
Based on attached class diagram create a project's structure.

Class Student contains data about one student:
first name,
last name,
grades of math, english and IT subjects,
number of absence lessons.

Class School implements an interface and contains
list of students: List <Student> list;
In the constructor create an object: list = new ArrayList<>();
Please implement all methods from interface.

Class Main has only one static method main and 
creates one instance of school. You have to open the source file,
read and parse data, create new student's objects and add them to the list.
(call method addStudent). 
Don't forget increment the counter .

In main method call all methods from the school class.


In your GitHub account create a new project : projectGoodSchool,
and regulary push and commit any changes you do.
I expect a lot of commits during next 12 days.
(I don't accept a project only with commits before deadline)

You have a lot of time to work on this project,learn Java, find solution, solve problems. ...
Internet, ebook and youtube is your source of information.
 
Regards
